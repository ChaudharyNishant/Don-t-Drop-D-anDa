The game is all about the hand-eye coordination and the speed of the fingers. You only have to save the eggs and not let them break.

The eggs will continuously fall from the top and you have to catch them in the bowl by moving the bowl left and right. The speed of the eggs falling will increase as you go on. You can pause the game and a pop-up window will be shown. You can quit at any time or restart the game at any time.
